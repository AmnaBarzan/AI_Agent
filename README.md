# 🧠 Autonomous AI Agent: Interactive Reasoning Assistant

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an autonomous AI agent capable of engaging with users through an interactive interface. The agent can reason, reflect, and improve its answers over time using advanced memory and tool usage. It integrates cutting-edge libraries like **LangChain**, **OpenAI API**, and **Streamlit**, demonstrating a rich pipeline for reasoning, memory recall, and user interaction.

---

## ✅ Learning Outcomes Achieved

- ✅ Designed and implemented an AI agent for a real-world reasoning task.
- ✅ Integrated planning, memory, reasoning, and user interaction.
- ✅ Used Python with libraries such as LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit.
- ✅ Demonstrated functionality through a recorded video (YouTube Short).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI GPT-4**
- **Streamlit**
- **FAISS Vector Store**
- **Hugging Face Transformers (optional)**

---

## 💡 Use Case

The agent is designed to assist users by:
- Receiving user input
- Recalling relevant past information
- Using tools to answer or reflect on its response
- Improving its performance iteratively

This showcases the AI's autonomy and ability to simulate human-like reasoning.
