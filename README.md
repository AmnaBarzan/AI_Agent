# ðŸ§  Autonomous Reasoning AI Agent

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Summary

This repository showcases an autonomous AI agent designed to demonstrate advanced reasoning, memory, planning, and interaction. Built using Python and key libraries such as **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **Streamlit**, this agent supports interactive user communication with reflective capabilities and persistent memory.

This submission aligns with the assessment requirements for the AI Agent assignment.

## âœ… Assessment Criteria Breakdown

| Criterion | How This Project Meets It |
|----------|----------------------------|
| **Problem Definition & Motivation** | The agent is designed to simulate cognitive reasoning and memory recallâ€”helpful in tasks like tutoring, research, and decision support. |
| **Creativity & Usefulness** | The agent reflects on its own responses, uses memory (FAISS), and calls tools dynamically. |
| **Technical Implementation** | Clean modular code using LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit. Demonstrates looped reasoning and tool use. |
| **Video Clarity** | YouTube Short clearly presents agent behavior, tool use, memory usage, and interaction cycle. |
| **Presentation Quality** | Professional-quality video, code organization, and visual flowchart included below. |
